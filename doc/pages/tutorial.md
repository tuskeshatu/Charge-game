# Tutorial for players

## Usage

In the main menu you can select from the 6 most recent levels you saved.

You can create levels by clicking editor mode and selecting an empty slot. Then you can draw freely any shape of charge you want by holding the LCtrl key and dragging while holding down the left or right mouse button. The left button will create opposite (attracting), the right identical (repulsive) charges compared to the player. If you hold down the LAlt key while dragging with the mouse, you can delete obstacles you placed.

In editor mode you can also resize the window to your own needs, as the size of the window is also the size of the level.

By pressing and holding the space key you can position the player to your mouse cursor.

You can also play the level you are creating while in editor mode. At the start you will be able to shoot the player by clicking on the player and dragging the mouse away in any direction. If you want to zero the speed of the player, you can press the Z key, if you want to reset the level to the starting sttate you can press the R key and if in editor mode you want to not reset the level but be able to shoot the player again you should press the R key while holding the LCtrl.

By pushing the escape key you can open the pause menu, where if you are in editor mode, you can click the save level button and specify a 20 character long level name consisting of lower-case letters of the english alphabet. If you press enter, the level will be saved and you will return to the pause menu. The next time you open the game you will be able to see the first 6 levels you created. If you create more levels, they will appear as you delete levels from the 6 appearing in the menu and restart the game.
